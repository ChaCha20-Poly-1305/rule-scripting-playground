# What the hell is this?

A set of scripts to generate domain-based routing rulesets sourced from @v2fly/domain-list-community. As of now, it generates rulesets for `category-ru` and `category-ip-geo-detect`, but it's possible to add other categories too (open an issue or PR if you have a request).

`*-domain.list` - DOMAIN-SUFFIX rulesets compatible with Mihomo and other tools that follow the same syntax (Shadowrocket, QuantumultX and others)

`*-unbound-domain-blocklist.conf` or `*-unbound-domain-whitelist.conf` - Unbound-compatible rulesets for DNS-based routing

The scripts automatically run and generate the rulesets every day at UTC 16:00.
